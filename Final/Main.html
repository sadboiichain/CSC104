                This is the final for my class CSC104: Website Development.<br>
                My site serves to replace an earlier assignment during my time at UAT where I had no knowledge of CSS or accessible design.<br>
                While this site is not likely to be updated past this class, I do have a more in-depth archive of my projects found in my projects page. <br>

                My name is Shanly Verschueren, but I often go by Shan out of convenience.<br>
                I spend my free time gaming and reading. <br>
                I largely do not have a presence online, and do not engage with many social medias.<br>
                Below are some of my favorites!
