            <p>
            This page is a personal showcase of my past and how it has changed. <br>
            Below this text will be an image of the original look of the site from an old assignment. <br> 

            Starting at the "Welcome to the Casino" text, anything on the site is the original HTML and JavaScript I wrote 4 years ago. <br>
            Everything present serves as a growth indicator of my understanding in accessible design as well as a chance to return to a project and fix the things I felt were unappealing to look at. <br>
            I have also added some buttons that tell how to play each game, as this was a feature I lacked. <br>
            <br>
            The old look:
            </p>

            <!--Picture of the original site-->
            <img src="./originalCasinoLook.png" alt="A screenshot of the site that no longer reflects how the site looks. The background is a bright red, the text is black and hard to read. The buttons present in the image are a bright green." >

            <button onclick="crapsHelp()">Craps</button>
